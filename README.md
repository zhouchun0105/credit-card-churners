# Goal

Manager at the bank wants to know why customers stop their credit card services. Our goal is to perform churn rate analysis to find the relationship between churning with customer attributes, customer activities, credit card attributes and bank services. This helps the bank reduce the cost of customer retention.

# Dataset
The data is about credit card customer, product and service. It has 21 features and 10128 rows. Customer demographic feature, customer card activity, credit card feature, and service feature are included. 

# Conclusion
Through churn analysis, we found that customers in middle age, with doctorate degrees, holding platinum(highest category) cards, having extremely low or high income, and having extremely high or low credit limit have high tendency to churn. The manager should spend more efforts on customers retention for those with these attributes.

In addition, customers with increased engagement with sales representative, customers with few other bank products, and customers with low revolving balance tend to have high churn rate. We recommend the manager to provide promotion bundles to sell more bank products to increase loyalty, prioritize customers with low balance, and optimize customer service efficiency and quality to reduce churn rate.

While the results of this analysis produced many interesting insights, there are still some limitations in this study. For example, many of the correlation coefficients as mentioned in the analysis are close to zero, which show that there is no significant relationship between the variables and churn rate. This may be because the relationship between the variables and churn rate is non-linear.

# Future Studies
The text or audio analysis can be performed to study why customer service leads to high churn rate.

Also, a machine learning model can be built with features of age, educational level, card type, income, credit limit, contacts with sales reprepresentative, holdings of other bank products, and revolving balance. With this machine learning model, the manager can predict whether certain customer will tend to attrite in order to prevent attrition beforehead and reduce customer rentention cost.
