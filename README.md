# Goal

Manager at the bank wants to know why customers stop their credit card services. Our goal is to perform churn rate analysis to find the relationship between churning with customer attributes, customer activities, credit card attributes and bank services. This helps the bank reduce the cost of customer retention.

# Dataset
The data is about credit card customer, product and service. It has 21 features and 10128 rows. Customer demographic feature, customer card activity, credit card feature, and service feature are included. 

# Conclusion
Through churn analysis, we found that customers in middle age, with doctorate degrees, holding platinum(highest category) cards, having extremely low or high income, and having extremely high or low credit limit have high tendency to churn. The manager should spend more efforts on customers retention for those with these attributes.

In addition, customers who contact with sales representative more often, customers who have few other bank products, and customers who have low revolving balance tend to have high churn rate. We recommend the manager to enhance by selling more bank products to the customer, keep an eye on customers with low balance, and dig deeper into why customer service leads to high churn rate.

# Future Studies
The text or audio analysis can be performed to study why customer service leads to high churn rate.

Also, a machine learning model can be built with features of age, educational level, card type, income, credit limit, contacts with sales reprepresentative, holdings of other bank products, and revolving balance. With this machine learning model, the manager can predict whether certain customer will tend to attrite in order to prevent attrition beforehead and reduce customer rentention cost.
